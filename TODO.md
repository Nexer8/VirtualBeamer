# TO DO

1. Introduce synchronization in data access. **Mariusz** :white_check_mark:
2. Fix crash detection. **Lorenzo**
3. Change unreliable UDP communication to TCP when necessary. **Mariusz**
4. Implement package loss handling (especially during slide sharing). **Lorenzo**
5. Delete all the *sleeps* from the code. (This should be done after a proper implementation of the package loss handling.) **Lorenzo**
6. What if multiple participants join during `agreeOnSlidesSender` process? **Mariusz**

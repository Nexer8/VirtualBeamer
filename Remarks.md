# Remarks

- A better option to share the load of sending slides when a new participant joins would be just randomly choosing one participant from the participant's list. Current agreement process would choose the same participant over and over again.
- During the leader election, it is possible that the new leader is not the person with the highest number of slides.
- When loading a new presentation, the leader should notify the participants so that they clear their slides first.
- It is possible that the packet loss when sending the slides would be lower if the packet size was smaller.
